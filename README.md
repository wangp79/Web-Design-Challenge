# Web-Design-Challenge

created a folder named: WebVisualisations and within the folder i created Assets, Resources and Visualisation folders.
All images and weather.ipynb are stores in Assets folder and csv files and data.html files are in Resources folder. The Visualisation folder was created to keep all html files of lat*vs_cloudiness, lat vs. humidity, las vs. temp, lat vs. windspeed and comparison file.
Based on the requirment of homework, I use python to read csv file and convert to Datafram, then use panda \_to_html* functions to write into html file.
created weahter.ipynb notebook to read csv file to generate 4 plots of latitiude vs cloudiness, humidity, temperatures and windspeed and stored all plotting images under images folder
